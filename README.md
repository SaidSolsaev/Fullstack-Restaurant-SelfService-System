## Project: Full-stack Restaurant Self-service System
A full-stack self-service system that allows restaurant customers to browse a menu, place orders, and (optionally) pay from their own devices.

## Features
Customer Application (React Native): The main app for customers to browse menus, view items, add to cart, and place orders. Includes API integration with Vipps for payments.
Kitchen/Staff Order System: An interface for restaurant staff to receive incoming orders in real-time. Staff can manage the order queue and update an order's status (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed").
Admin Dashboard (React.js): A separate web-based dashboard for restaurant management. Provides analytics on sales, order volume, and popular items, along with other administrative tools.
Public Order Status Screen: A customer-facing display showing the live status of all active orders ("Accepted", "Being Prepared", "Completed").
Backend Service: A robust API built with Node.js and Express to manage orders, menu data, payments, and system communication.
Persistent Storage: Uses a PostgreSQL database to store all menu items, orders, and user information.
